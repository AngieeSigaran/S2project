Keeping dice: 
    A player must keep at least 1 or more dice per roll.

    To be able to get onto the scoreboard, the player must roll 350. 

   The Player can continuously roll the dice to their liking, but if they do not roll at least one or more dice part of the point system, then they lose all of the points made during that turn. (it does not contribute to their score board)  

   If a player rolls: all ones, 3 pairs, 1-6, then they must roll the dice again to receive or maybe lose those points.
